# Module 3

- Functions
- Algorithms

## Learning Goals

- Work effectively with a partner using Pair Programming
- Follow steps to develop a module (mini-project)
- Learn key skills and take notes for the module 3 test

## Pair Programming Steps

### Step 0: Set up working protocol

- Who is the driver for how long
- How to resolve conflicts

### Step 1: Create a file

- Use given data and create a travel.txt file for your module
- Use file operations (open, read/write, close) to load the data into Python
- Create the function `show_loaded_data()` to display the loaded data

### Step 2: Place the travel data into a 2D data structure

- Consider 4 data structure options (list of list, list of dictionary, dictionary of dictionary, dictionary of list) and decide
- Process a row into 3 items and place them in the data structure
- Use a loop to display the data in the following order "Desination", "Transport Methods", "ID"
- Add a separator like "-" between items: `Werribee Open Range Zoo - Car - 20250105`
- Create the function `show_data()` to display the items of data
- Use a parameter `separator` to accept different separators from users


### Step 3: Sort and Search



### Step N: Test

- use `assert` to test your module
- use `doctest` to test your module
- use custom functions to test your module
