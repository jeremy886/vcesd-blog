# Module 3

- Functions
- Algorithms

## Learning Goals

- Work effectively with a partner using Pair Programming
- Follow steps to develop a module (mini-project)
- Learn key skills and take notes for the module 3 test

## Pair Programming Steps

### Step 0: Set Up Working Protocol

- Decide who will be the driver and for how long
- Agree on how to resolve any conflicts

```

How to open and read the raw data in Python

```python
file = open("travel.txt", "r")

big_string = file.read()
print(big_string)

lines = big_string.splitlines()
for line in lines:
    print(line)

# OR
lines = file.readlines()
for line in lines:
    print(line)


file.close()
``

### Step 1: Create a File

- Use the given data to create a `travel.txt` file for your module
- Use file operations (`open`, read/write, `close`) to load the data into Python
- Create a function called `show_loaded_data()` to display the loaded data

### Step 2: Store the Travel Data in a 2D Data Structure

- Consider four data structure options (`list of lists`, `list of dictionaries`, `dictionary of dictionaries`, `dictionary of lists`) and choose one
- Process each row into three items and insert them into the chosen data structure
- Use a loop to display the data in the following order: "Destination", "Transport Method", "ID"
- Add a separator such as a dash between items: `Werribee Open Range Zoo - Car - 20250105`
- Create a function called `show_data()` to display the data
- Use a parameter called `separator` to allow users to customise the separator
- Write a doctest to verify that the data type is correct


```python
def show_data(data, separator=' - '):
    """
    Display each item in the travel data with the given separator.

    >>> sample_data = [
    ...     ['Werribee Open Range Zoo', 'Car', '20250105'],
    ...     ['Melbourne Museum', 'Train', '20250106']
    ... ]
    >>> show_data(sample_data, separator=' - ')
    Werribee Open Range Zoo - Car - 20250105
    Melbourne Museum - Train - 20250106
    """
    for row in data:
        print(separator.join(row))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```


### Step 3: Sorting Algorithm

- Choose one sorting algorithm to implement: either Selection Sort or Quick Sort
- Choose one field (e.g. Destination, Transport Method, or ID) to sort the data by
- Create a sorting function with parameters like: `bubble_sort_by_field(data, field)`

**Note:** To ensure you meet the test requirements, copy both the Selection Sort and Quick Sort Python code into your folder.


### Step 4: Test the Sorting Algorithm

- Load and process the data file into the data structure `data2d`
- Write a custom test function: `test_data2d_row_length()`
- Write a second test function: `test_data2d_item_number()`
- Propose a third test function:

### Step 5: Search Algorithm

- Choose one search algorithm to implement: either Linear Search or Binary Search
- Choose one field to search within the data
- Create a search function with parameters like: `xxx_search_by_field(data, field)`
